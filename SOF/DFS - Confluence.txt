Introduction




This document provides a detailed description of the transform and load process for the data marts for Statement of Fees.



Every year, for each payment account the Rabobank sends on a yearly basis information about the use of an account to the customer. The main target is: increasing of the quality and transparency of payment services in order to simplify the consumer’s search for cheaper payment services.



SOF microservices gathers the information from the various systems like ART, COK and POD and eventually composes the ‘Statement of Fees’ for every customer. Eventually it will be processed by CEA and the ‘Printstraat’ and sent digitally or by paper to the customer.



Now that CGW/POD will be decommissioned, we will set up a new delivery process from IFP.

We have to send some information about the use of services and compensations paid by the customer, related to debit and credit cards.

And also for Cross Border transactions, where the Rate Margin was not transparent. This is the margin which the Rabobank applies to midrate of a foreign exchange transaction to determine the bid or sell rate which is applied to a transaction. There are more variants were costs are charged, however in the SOF only EUR accounts are in scope.



From IFP perspective, we store the data in a separate data mart in IFP. This data mart is input for the file that has to be created and sent to SOF microservices.

The structure and content of the file(s) will be similar to that already being  delivered by CGW. The decision on the process of delivering the data files is yet to be decided.

General
The information gathered is stored in a data mart.

This data mart contains debit and credit card transaction information of grouped by IBAN of the payment agreement, currency of the payment agreement, statement of fees transaction group, transaction date.





Determining statement of fees transaction group for debit card


9101 - Debit card, Pay by debit card, in foreign currency, exchange rate surcharge

9107 - Debit card, Cash withdrawal, in foreign currency, exchange rate surcharge





Determine IBAN and currency code for Clearing transactions (debit card)


We only process private clients.

Business clients are not involved in this because they already get a good insight in their costs in another way.

All cards, debit as well as credit, are linked to an EUR account.



The account number/IBAN of a clearing debit card transaction is determined as follows:

To get all debit card transactions - Get the Cardholder IBAN from dc_trx_clrg_issng_di where Card type code = ‘DBT’
To get currency code - Get those records from bsc_pymt_agrm_ds where IBAN = Cardholder IBAN(dc_trx_clrg_issng_di) and currency code is EUR
To filter only the private customers - Read those rows in cdf_ggm_ar_hist where Arrangement Account IBAN = Cardholder IBAN(dc_trx_clrg_issng_di) and Arrangement Primary Natural Person Relation Id is not NULL

Determine IBAN and currency code for Clearing transactions (credit card)


The account number/IBAN of a clearing debit card transaction is determined as follows:

To get all credit card transactions - Get the Cardholder IBAN from dc_trx_clrg_issng_di where Card type code = ‘CDT’
To get the currency code - Get those records from bsc_pymt_agrm_ds where IBAN = Cardholder IBAN(dc_trx_clrg_issng_di) and currency code is EUR
To filter only the private customers - Read those rows in cdf_ggm_ar_hist where Arrangement Account IBAN = Cardholder IBAN(dc_trx_clrg_issng_di) and Arrangement Primary Natural Person Relation Id is not NULL


There are 2 records for each ‘POS’ transaction of non-euro currency (one is transaction record and other one is surcharge fee record). 

There would be 3 records for each ‘ATM’ transaction of non-euro currency (one is transaction record and other one is surcharge fee record and third one is ATM withdrawal fee record). 

There would be 2 records for each ‘ATM’ transaction of euro currency (one is transaction record and other one is surcharge fee record).  

 

2 steps -

 

Filter transaction records where
Card Transaction ATM Or POS Code = ‘POS’ or ‘ATM’and Card Transaction Original N3 Currency Code <> 978 (‘EUR’) 
or  

Card Transaction ATM Or POS Code = ‘ATM’and Card Transaction Original N3 Currency Code = 978 (‘EUR’) 
 

Get the surcharge fee / ATM withdrawal fee record for each POS or ATM transaction record based on below condition:
Card Transaction Local Date of fee record is same as transaction record
Card Transaction Local Time is same as transaction record
Cardholder IBAN is same as transaction record
Card Transaction Original Booking Number is same as Card Transaction Original Booking Number of transaction record
 

Rabobank has also so called ‘revolving’ credit cards. Roodstand (debit balance) is possible on these cards, and interest must be paid for that. That is column 03DT.
